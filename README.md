# Bank Customer Analytics Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer data for a bank to **reduce churn, improve service delivery, and enhance customer satisfaction**. Multiple datasets, including customer demographics, transactions, exit information, and active customer profiles, were analyzed to identify key churn drivers, profitable segments, and actionable insights.  

The analysis was performed using **Excel, SQL, and Power BI**, combining data consolidation, preprocessing, advanced querying, and interactive dashboarding. The insights generated provide guidance for targeted retention strategies, upselling opportunities, and geographic expansion.

## Tools Used
- **Excel**: Data consolidation, cleaning, and preliminary analysis.  
- **SQL**: Data storage, querying, and identification of churn drivers.  
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards for visualizing customer segmentation, churn, and product engagement.

## Key Analysis Steps
1. **Data Consolidation & Preprocessing**
   - Imported multiple datasets into Excel and Power BI.
   - Cleaned data to resolve missing values and inconsistencies.

2. **Data Storage & Manipulation**
   - Imported cleaned data into SQL database.
   - Performed queries to analyze churn, credit behavior, and product engagement.

3. **Data Analysis & Visualization**
   - Built interactive Power BI dashboards.
   - Visualized customer segments, churn patterns, and product ownership.

4. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - High-risk churn segments: females aged 50+ (52.4%), German customers (32.4%).  
   - Targeted upselling and cross-selling opportunities for single-product holders (29.45%).  
   - Geographic expansion focus: France and Spain.  
   - Loyalty programs for stable mid-age, mid-credit score customers.
